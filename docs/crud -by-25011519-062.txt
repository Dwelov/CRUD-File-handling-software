📘 Project Description: Student Record Management Functions
This project manages student records stored in a CSV file (file.csv). Each record contains:

Roll Number (unique identifier)

Name

Marks (multiple subjects stored as integers)

Average (calculated float value)

The following functions handle adding, updating, and deleting student records.

1. addStudents()
Purpose
Adds a new student record to the CSV file.

Operates in append mode so existing data is preserved.

Working
Opens the file using ofstream with ios::app.

Checks if the file exists; if not, prints an error.

Writes the new student’s roll number, name, marks, and average in comma-separated format.

Closes the file and confirms success.

Example Flow
Code
Input: RollNumber=101, Name="Ali", Marks={85, 90, 78}, Average=84.3
File after append:
101,Ali,85,90,78,84.3
2. updateRecord()
Purpose
Updates an existing student’s record in the CSV file.

Searches for the student using their roll number.

Working
Opens the file using ifstream.

Reads all lines into a vector.

If a line starts with the given roll number, it is replaced with the updated data.

If roll number not found, prints an error.

Rewrites the entire file with updated content using ofstream.

Example Flow
Code
Before update:
101,Ali,85,90,78,84.3

Update: Name="Ali Khan", Marks={88, 92, 80}, Average=86.6

After update:
101,Ali Khan,88,92,80,86.6
3. deleteRecord()
Purpose
Deletes a student’s record from the CSV file.

Searches by roll number.

Working
Opens the file using ifstream.

Reads all lines into a vector except the one matching the roll number.

If roll number not found, prints an error.

Rewrites the file (using ofstream with ios::trunc) excluding the deleted record.

Confirms deletion.

Example Flow
Code
Before delete:
101,Ali,85,90,78,84.3
102,Sara,88,91,79,86.0

Delete: RollNumber=101

After delete:
102,Sara,88,91,79,86.0
✨ Key Features of These Functions
File Handling: Uses ifstream and ofstream for reading/writing CSV files.

Error Handling: Displays clear error messages if file not found or roll number missing.

Data Integrity: Ensures records are properly formatted and file is safely rewritten.

Flexibility: Supports multiple marks per student using vector<int>.
